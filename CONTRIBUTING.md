# Contributing to Declutter Enhanced

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Declutter Enhanced as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/declutter-enhanced.git
cd declutter-enhanced
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000/demo.html to see the demo

### Code Style

- Use ESLint configuration provided in the project
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write meaningful commit messages

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include both unit and integration tests where appropriate

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions and classes
- Update inline comments for complex logic

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and motivation
- Possible implementation approach
- Any relevant mockups or examples
